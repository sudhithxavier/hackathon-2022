AWA is a climate dynamic NFT project built on XinFin (XDC) with Plugin (PLI), the oracle protocol as the key source of real world weather data. AWA works based on climate change instances - tracking and recording it on-chain. 

How It Works:
AWA (XDC) monitors temperature data from all major cities in the world and based on historic data, if a new all time high or new all time low is recorded, our algorithm will mint a dynamic NFT with a generative art, details like date, city and new temperature. The minting and art generation is dynamic and completly controlled by the algorithm. Over time, AWA's NFTs shall be an immutable record of weather data. We are also gathering a climate enthusist community to create a DAO whcih will administer different climate positive activities and will have a treausry to aid in climate related catastrophies in a quick and reliable manner. We are aiming to built a community of large and small enterprises to help with different Corporate social responsibility activities realted to climate change and weather.
